/**
 * Regression coverage for the Storage write/delete failure ordering bug
 * Christopher Finks reported as Issue 4.
 *
 * Pre-fix flow inside ImageUploadRequest::handleImages:
 *   Storage::put(new file)   // return value discarded
 *   deleteExistingImage()    // unconditional
 *   $item->image = $new;     // unconditional
 *
 * If put returned false (silent-fail mode on the default local disk), the
 * old file was destroyed and the model row ended up referencing a file
 * that never landed on disk. The fix captures the put return, only
 * proceeds to delete + reassign when the write succeeded, and mirrors the
 * same check inside deleteExistingImage so a failed delete does not null
 * out the model reference either.
 *
 * We exercise the fix through the manufacturers update endpoint because it
 * has a straightforward image field and the fewest confounding variables
 * of the many handleImages callers, but the fix applies to every model
 * whose controller ultimately routes through ImageUploadRequest.
